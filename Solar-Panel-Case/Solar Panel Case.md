# Solar Panel Case
This file contains all the parts necessary to assemble a case for a 130x150mm (~2.5W) solar panel. We laser cut them with a 90W tube at a speed of 50 and a power of 60-65.

After being cut out of a sheet of plywood, the parts fold to form finger joints on all edges, and are held in place with a little glue.
