# Engineering-Brightness
1.3 billion people across the world lack a source of artificial lighting, and are unable to safely leave thier homes or do work after dark. Often a rudimentary kerosene lamp is used, but carbon monoxide and combustion byproducts build up in the air, leading to death in some cases. Kerosene is also very expensive, and provides little useful light. 

Engineering Brightnes is a program designed to provide free, safe, and reliable artifical lighting to the world. 

Originally started at Preston Middle School, Colorado Early Colleges Fort Collins is currently prototyping a new design, and the files are available here. The electrical system has been sucessfully prototyped, and the mechanical enclosure is currently under development.
